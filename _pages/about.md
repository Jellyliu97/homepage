I am first year of PhD in computer science and technology at the **State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology** (LANDS Group) of Nanjing University. I obtained my master's degree in artificial intelligence from the **State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves** (AEM Group) of Southeast University, China. My current research interest includes machine learning (diffusion model), computer vision (including medical image processing), multi-modal intelligent sensing (mmwave vision), audio processing and human-computer interaction. I hope build a learning and research path from the sensing and recognition to cognitive and embodied intelligence for AI agent (e.g. robot, UAV, edge device, intelligent vehicle and so on).
